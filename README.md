## 📜 Project Overview
**VIDHI** is an AI-powered legal awareness and justice access assistant built for the **Indian legal system**.  
It helps people understand their rights, laws, and legal procedures under Indian law, and guides them towards justice in a **clear, simple, and respectful manner**.
